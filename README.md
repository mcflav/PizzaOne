# PizzaOne
This is a single page web application created in Angular. It uses TD (template driven) and Reactive Forms. It allows the user place an order online. The order form is reactive and allows the user to create a pizza order by select the crust type, size, and added toppings. The user can also order wings, breadsticks, and/or drinks. The user is then provided a total for the items once the order is submitted. The data is stored in a mongoDB backend database. I also created a backend restful apis application using Node.js and deployed the project to Heroku. This Angular application uses the apis from the Node.js restful apis application. That project can also be found on gitHub - https://github.com/mcflav/pizzaOne-backend.
